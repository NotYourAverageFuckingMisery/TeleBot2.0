# TeleBot2.0
Really simple bot for Telegram.

Uses the positionstack.com and openweather APIs to get te current weather in selected city now.
To use it you have to change YOUR_API_KEY to your actual api keys in the code.

!Using Panic in error handling for the sake of development/debugging. Gotta change that in case of deploying this project.
